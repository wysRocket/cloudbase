# AI Generated Website

This is a high-performance, interactive website generated by AI. It features a modern tech stack including React 18, Framer Motion, and Tailwind CSS.

## 🚀 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
*   **Node.js**: Version 18.0.0 or higher is required. [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
*   **npm**: Usually comes with Node.js.

## 🛠️ Installation

1.  **Unzip the project** to your desired location.
2.  Open your terminal/command prompt and navigate to the project folder:
    ```bash
    cd path/to/project-folder
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    *This may take a minute as it installs React and other libraries.*

## 💻 Local Development

To start the development server and view the website in your browser:

```bash
npm run dev
```

*   The terminal will show a local URL (usually `http://localhost:5173`).
*   Open that link in your browser.
*   The server supports Hot Module Replacement (HMR), so changes to files will update the browser instantly.

## 📦 Building for Production

To create an optimized build for deployment:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate a `dist` folder containing the compiled HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files ready for static hosting.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

*   **"Missing dependencies" error**: Run `npm install` again to ensure all packages are downloaded.
*   **Vite error**: If you encounter version conflicts, try deleting `node_modules` and `package-lock.json` and running `npm install` again.
